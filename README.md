### Bailey's Cool, Very Cool hangout. 
#### Introduction
As an introduction to this new "Project" capital P, I guess we start with who I am and what this is about. My name is Bailey, and I wanted a place to write about Fantasy Football, Finance, and other stuff (Politics... maybe).  
I have a degree in Finance from a random state school namely, _The University of South Florida_. Go Bulls. So yeah, not too extravagent to say the least. 

As an unemployed 25 year old getting a second degree in Accounting from the university formerly mentioned I find that I have a lot of down time. 
I have used said down time on things like TikTok, Instagram, Twitch, and Youtube. My phone screentime has been at a steady rate for the past years even while still employed. So, I say that to say this "Project" is a way to use my time in a _productive?_ manner. 

If you have found this page and you know me personally, well, that's cool I guess. If you have found this page through a job application I have sent or are a prospective employer, don't take this too seriously, please (I'm begging). If you otherwise don't know me and have no interest in hiring me, that's cool too.  

Now, I guess I don't know what else to say for this intro but, hello, welcome, and I hope this lasts a good little while as it would be helpful for myself. I think? 

Anyway, thanks for stopping by and see ya later.
